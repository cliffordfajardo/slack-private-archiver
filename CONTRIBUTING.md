# GIT workflow

## Steps
* Each dev forks & clones Master repo.
* Any new features should be on it's own branch w/ the following naming convention:

 ####lastName/feature/issue-tracker-number
 (*Ex. Arya/userAuth/#54*)

* After completing a feature, commit and push to corresponding branch on your forked repo, ensuring it passes a Travis CI build in the process.
* Create PR.
* Have at least 2 peers approve PR before merge can be made [by 2nd reviewer].
* Merge into Master.
* Whole team rebases.
* Repeat as necessary.
